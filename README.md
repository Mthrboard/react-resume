# Chad Hjelle React Resume

This project was scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It builds the App.css file with all necessary Tailwind CSS styles, and then\
bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best\
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run build:vite`

Builds just the React app in production mode with minified files and hashes.

### `npm run build:tailwind`

Builds just the App.css file with all used Tailwind CSS components, utilities\
and other classes.

### `npm run watch`

Watches all source files for Tailwind CSS classes, and rebuilds the Tailwind
CSS bundle when it detects any changes.

### `npm run preview`

Allows you to preview the output of the `npm run build` command.\
Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) to view the output before
you deploy it to a production server.

Note: You must run `npm run build` before running this command, or you will
get an error that it cannot GET /.
